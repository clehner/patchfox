# Release 2021.5.3

## Changes

* The _raw message_ view now includes more links to documentation.


## Bugs

* **Calendar:** The validator for _gathering updates_ was very naive and has been replaced with a more robust one that uses [ssb-gathering-schema](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-gathering-schema).
