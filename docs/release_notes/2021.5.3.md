# Release 2021.5.3

## Changes

* The _raw message_ view now includes more links to documentation.
* Changed the [browser polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) from a vendored copy to module from NPM.


## Bugs

* **Calendar:** The validator for _gathering updates_ was very naive and has been replaced with a more robust one that uses [ssb-gathering-schema](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-gathering-schema).
* **GlobalMenu:** Added a check to display the _sidebar trigger_ only in browser that support `browser.sidebarAction.*` APIs.
