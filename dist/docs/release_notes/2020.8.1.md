# Release 2021.2.1

## Fixes

- **npm scripts:** The `copy:docs` script was wrong and was not copying root files.
- **Spectre.css:** Browserify was borking the import from `node_modules/`, so I made an extra `copy:spectre-icons-css` script that copies it to the _default theme_ directory, and patched the SCSS code to import from there.
